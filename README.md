# ASDEV | Alireza Safaei

Production-Grade Web Systems Engineer focused on **architecture, scalability, and reliability**.
I design and harden web systems for real-world constraints—**operational excellence, observability, and defensible delivery**.

**Core pillars**
- Stability / Resilience (Reliability, performance, incident-proof systems)
- Localization / Reduced external dependency (pragmatic solutions for constrained environments)
- Evidence / Reporting (metrics, dashboards, traceability, production readiness)

**What I can help with**
- Architecture reviews & system design (from MVP to scale)
- Reliability & performance improvements (SLOs, bottlenecks, incident reduction)
- Observability & production readiness (logging/metrics/tracing, runbooks)
